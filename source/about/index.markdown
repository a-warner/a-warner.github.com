Hi!

I'm Andrew Warner. I studied Computer Science and Psychology at Wesleyan University.  I have worked at companies large and small and with tech stacks ranging from Java/Spring to [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). I'm currently the Director of Engineering at [Genius](http://genius.com), where I'm working on creating technology to annotate all of text.

Before joining Genius, I worked at [Loosecubes](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/loosecubes), where I was a Lead Engineer and briefly CTO, and at [The Ladders](http://www.theladders.com/), where I was a Lead Engineer and [scrum master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29).

In my spare time, I love coding up projects that make my life easier.  Some cool examples are [Ghost Dog](https://github.com/a-warner/ghost_dog), which helps you wrangle `method_missing` in Ruby, and [Sports Scraper](https://github.com/a-warner/sports-scraper) (bad name!) which scrapes ESPN for fantasy football info and provides a better interface for last-minute drafting decisions.  On the non-coding side, I enjoy playing squash, watching my beloved Patriots and Red Sox, playing lawn games, swimming, and karaoke.
