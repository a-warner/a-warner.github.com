Developers love comments! Everyone who writes a comment thinks that they&#8217;re making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">pareto improvement</a> to the codebase, when in fact it&#8217;s quite the opposite. Comments are especially dangerous because there are many situations where it <i>seems</i> like a comment will help, but beware the siren&#8217;s call.

I hate reading articles that make abstract arguments, so enough bloviating, let&#8217;s check out some examples. Here are some concrete uses of comments that I&#8217;ve seen a lot, and how they can be easily avoided.

    <updated>2014-08-13T23:25:46-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.leastastonished.com/blog/2014/08/13/choosing-a-new-theme</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a week ago I finally decided that I wanted to start blogging again. I love talking about programming, but I often find it
difficult to motivate myself to write a blog post about it. I sat down to write a post, and sure enough, I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything
to blog about. So instead I procrastinated by thinking about all of the things I wanted to do to make my blog better.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The most obvious problem was that I was still using the default <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a> theme.
It has a lot of nice qualities: it&rsquo;s easy to navigate around, easy to read, and it&rsquo;s responsive! Unfortunately,
using the default theme meant that my site also looked exactly like
<a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/Octopress-Sites">everyone else&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p>Now Octopress is also great because it&rsquo;s extremely easy for anyone to make a theme. In fact, a
<a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">bunch of people</a> have already done exactly that. Looking at the
list of themes, though, I realized that it was difficult to tell which ones were &ldquo;the good ones.&rdquo; Normally when I have a huge list of
products that I want to comb through, I&rsquo;m on a website where I can easily sort by some metadata about the product. (e.g. Amazon)
My preferred sort is always by popularity: I basically trust the wisdom of the crowd. On Amazon, for example, I&rsquo;m much more interested
in the product with the most reviews than I am in the product with the best average review. Unfortunately, GitHub tables have no such
convenient sorting options!</p>

<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;m a programmer, and, wanting to procrastinate more, I decided that I wanted to write a quick script to sort projects by
number of stars. As it turns out, it&rsquo;s pretty simple to use <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> and <a href="https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb">Octokit</a> to get the information I want:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/60afe3ffdd0872719247.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require 'nokogiri'
require 'octokit'
require 'open-uri'

github = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token =&gt; ENV['GH_TOKEN'])

doc = Nokogiri::HTML.fragment(open('https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes').read)

doc.search('table tr td:first a:first').map do |a|
  a['href'] =~ %r{https?://github.com/([^/]+)/([^?/]+)(\?|$|/)} &amp;&amp; [$1, $2]
end.compact.map do |owner, repo_name|
  begin
    github.repository(:owner =&gt; owner, :name =&gt; repo_name)
  rescue Octokit::NotFound
  end
end.compact.sort_by { |repo| -repo.stargazers_count }.each do |repo|
  puts &quot;#{repo.html_url} - #{repo.stargazers_count}&quot;
end</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This script simply:</p>

<ul>
<li>scrapes the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">themes page</a></li>
<li>parses it with Nokogiri</li>
<li>finds the table with the themes</li>
<li>selects the link from the first column of each row, which is the link to the theme repository on GitHub</li>
<li>extracts the owner and repo name using a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; regular expression</li>
<li>maps owner/repo to number of stars</li>
<li>prints a sorted list of repo links and stars</li>
</ul>


<p>and voila, we have an Amazon-like sort by popular-type situation. (check out the results in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/a-warner/60afe3ffdd0872719247">gist comments</a>)</p>

<p>After checking out the popular themes, I decided, contrary to my usual shopping strategy, that I wasn&rsquo;t in love with any of them.
I was looking for something simple, single-column, and easy to read. I ended up settling on
<a href="https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace">whiterspace</a>, which, even though it only had 45 stars, was exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>So, while I didn&rsquo;t end up choosing the most popular theme, it was still useful to be able to look at a mapping of themes to popularity.
In the end, whiterspace got one more star, and I got a cleaner, more distinct-looking blog. Oh, and in doing all of this work, I ended up with a
somewhat interesting topic to blog about (I hope!), accomplishing my original goal in a somewhat roundabout way. Win win win!</p>

    <id>http://www.leastastonished.com/blog/2013/04/21/the-3-ways-to-get-the-size-of-an-active-record-relation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and your first thought is, &ldquo;there are 3 ways to get the size of a relation?&rdquo;, then
you&rsquo;ve come to the right place! Basically, given a relation like <code>Post.all</code> or <code>User.first.posts</code>, when you
want to know the size, you&rsquo;ve got 3 choices: <code>size</code>, <code>length</code>, and <code>count</code>.  At first glance, it seems like these
might do the same thing, right?  Not so!  There are some key differences between them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>TL;DR - use <code>size</code>, it usually &ldquo;Does the Right Thing&rdquo;</p>

<p>First off, some background: both <code>Post.all</code> and <code>User.first.posts</code> are instances of <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code>,
a very sneaky and
powerful class which manages lazy loading of records from the database. (full disclosure, <code>User.first.posts</code> is
actually an instance of <code>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy</code>, but the difference between the two isn&rsquo;t
really relevant to this article).  It makes a best effort to filter, and
order records until the last possible minute when you actually ask for something concrete.  It&rsquo;s that lazy loading
which allows you to write code like <code>Post.where(featured: true).order(created_at: :desc).paginate(page: 1)</code>, which
will generate only one query for the first page of posts.  If you want to get the size of a Relation, there are
3 different ways to ask for it:</p>

<h3>length</h3>

<p>The simplest of the three methods, <code>length</code> is simply delegated to <code>to_a</code> on the collection; in other words, calling
length is equivalent to calling <code>Post.all.to_a.length</code>.  It will query for ALL records, initialize ruby objects for
all of them, and then get the size of the array.  Probably not what you want if you just want to display the count
of the Posts on your blog!</p>

<h3>count</h3>

<p>Does a sql <code>count(*)</code> query for the count of the records in the database.  You probably want to use this method
if you only ever need the count of the records in the association for whatever you&rsquo;re doing.  In the example above,
just displaying a count on the page is a perfect use case for <code>count</code>.</p>

<h3>size</h3>

<p>Size makes a best effort attempt to &ldquo;Do The Right Thing&rdquo; based on the current state of the collection.  Here is the
actual source for size:</p>

<p>From <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation.rb#L205">ActiveRecord::Relation</a>:
<code>ruby lib/active_record/relation.rb
  # Returns size of the records.
  def size
    loaded? ? @records.length : count
  end
</code></p>

<p>Great comment by the way, I never would have known what <code>size</code> did without it.</p>

<p>Basically, size is a heuristic switch between <code>length</code> and <code>count</code>.  If the collection is loaded, it just
gets the length of the loaded array, otherwise it will hit the database with a query.  As pointed out in a
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/collection_proxy.rb#L677">much more informative comment which is for some reason in the CollectionProxy object instead</a>,
you&rsquo;ll end up with an extra query if you call <code>size</code> and then actually need the elements of the collection later.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases the differences are completely irrelevant, but, for my money, <code>size</code> is the best of the 3 options.
It does the best job of not leaking details about what&rsquo;s going on under the hood in terms of lazy loading in Active
Record.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-21T17:41:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.leastastonished.com/blog/2013/04/21/use-the-rails-router-for-routing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a quick one, and the title says most of it.  Basically, you should never have code like this in
your app:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby some_controller.rb">class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController
  def some_action
    if something_about_the_url?
      do_something
      render :template =&gt; :foo
    else
      do_something_else
      render :template =&gt; :baz
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>The whole point of the router is to handle stuff about the url!  Instead, move whatever the logic inside
<code>something_about_the_url?</code> does upstream to the router layer.  For example, say you want to display a different
home page for www.mysite.com and blog.mysite.com.  This can be accomplished very easily using the router:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby routes.rb">constraints subdomain: 'blog' do
  root to: 'blog#home'
end

root to: 'static#home'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, in this specific case, you must have the subdomain route above the <code>root</code> route, otherwise the router
will match the route to <code>static#home</code> before it gets to the subdomain constraint.  Remember that the router
checks routes in order.  All set!</p>

    <link href="http://www.leastastonished.com/blog/2013/03/17/simple-active-record-query-debugging-in-the-rails-console/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-17T18:22:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.leastastonished.com/blog/2013/03/17/simple-active-record-query-debugging-in-the-rails-console</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stop me if this sounds familiar.  You&rsquo;re tooling around in the Rails console, testing out some new code you&rsquo;re working on (or debugging some slow/broken code), and you see a ton of repeat queries.</p>

<p>I have this experience frequently; usually I can figure out what&rsquo;s going on, but sometimes it can be quite tricky to track down the source of extra queries.  Whenever I want to figure out where a method is getting called from, one easy and lazy solution is to add a debugger statement in that code.  But where the heck do I add a debugger for sql statements?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It turns out that Active Record has a fairly unified choke-point for query execution on a per-model basis - <code>#find_by_sql</code>.  So, now that we know the method, what&rsquo;s the best way to add the debugger statement?  Well, we <em>could</em> just open up the gem code, but then we have to restart our console, and we run the risk of forgetting to remove the statement or otherwise screwing up the gem code in some way that&rsquo;s difficult to track down.  We could monkey patch the method, but even that sounds onerous, especially if we want the method to be usable again without hitting that debugger statement later in our session.</p>

<p>Enter a relatively short addition to your <code>.irbrc</code> or <code>.pryrc</code>!  Simply add the following method:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def add_debugger(clazz, method)
  debugger_method = binding.respond_to?(:pry) ? 'binding.pry' : 'debugger'

  unless clazz.method_defined? "#{method}_with_debugger"
    clazz.class_eval &lt;&lt;-CODE, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
      def #{method}_with_debugger(*args, &amp;block)
        #{debugger_method}
        #{method}_without_debugger(*args, &amp;block)
      end
      alias_method_chain :#{method}, :debugger
    CODE
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that my debugger preference is <code>pry</code>, if it&rsquo;s available.  You can of course adjust the above code per your preference.  Now we can simply run:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">add_debugger MyModel.singleton_class, :find_by_sql
</code></pre>

<p>Running through our problem code again, you should find yourself in the debugger for any queries on <code>MyModel</code>.  Once in the debugger, simply inspect <code>caller</code> to figure out what pesky bit of code is generating all of the extra queries.</p>

<p>This is great, but it would incomplete if we had to restart the server in order to remove the debugger statement!  The following snippet should do the trick:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def remove_debugger(clazz, method)
  return unless clazz.method_defined? "#{method}_with_debugger"

  clazz.class_eval do
    alias_method method, "#{method}_without_debugger"
    undef_method "#{method}_with_debugger"
    undef_method "#{method}_without_debugger"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Just run <code>remove_debugger MyModel.singleton_class, :find_by_sql</code>, and you&rsquo;re back to regular development.</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got this method, adding debugging statements to your own code or 3rd party code is a breeze!</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/a-warner/dotfiles/blob/master/.railsrc">.railsrc</a> for more little one-off development helper methods.</p>

<p>Is there an easier way to do this with pry?  Is there a gem that just does this and makes my silly code obsolete?  Let me know in the comments!</p>
